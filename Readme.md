### To run this Server
(Assuming Node.js and npm are installed)
1. In the root directory, perform "npm install" to download npm packages.
2. Make a .env file in root directory, inside that file, pass in two variables.
    1. MONGO_URL = {Insert Your MongoDB URL}
    2. JWT_SECRET = {Insert some random value as a Secret}
3. To run the Server, perform "npm start"
4. The port is hardcoded as 3000. So, to try the API's, use http://localhost:3000/
